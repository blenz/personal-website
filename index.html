                  My name is Brett and a graduate of the University of
                  California, Irvine where I studied Computer Science and
                  specialized in Information and Networked Systems. Originally,
                  I began studying business, and after earning my A.S. in
                  Business Administration and Mathematics, I realized I didn't
                  truly enjoy business like I did programming. I was fortunate
                  enough to change my major late and still got into the
                  university of my choice.
                </p>
                <p>
                  While at U.C. Irvine, I've taken classes in a number of
                  different classes involving computers and did a summer
                  internship with a company developing and maintaining a Web
                  Application.
                </p>
                <p>
                  After graduating UCI, I did another internship learning the
                  processes of testing and perfomance of web applications. I
                  really enjoy combining my background in programming and
                  development with my experience in testing and perfomance to
                  help create a performant, robust, and delightful web
                  application.
